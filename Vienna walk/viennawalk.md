2. Palais Ephrussi
The rapid burgeoning of the Jewish middle class in Vienna began with the
Fundamental Laws of December 1867 when Jews were granted full equal civil and
legal rights including the being allowed to buy land in the city for the first time. The
ringstrasse replaced the city’s medieval walls and was developed between1860-
1890.
Wealthy Jewish families known as the Ringstrasse Elite were key developers of this
area building opulent palaces and acting as patrons of the arts and culture. This was
in stark contrast to many Jewish immigrants who lived in overcrowded, cramped
conditions in the Leopoldstadt.
An example of the ‘Ringstrasse elite’ were the Ephrussi family, originally Odessa-
based grain merchants who established a prominent banking dynasty in 19th-century
Vienna, becoming major art patrons and social figures. The 1938 Nazi annexation,
led to the seizure of their house and assets and their forced exile. The family story is
recorded in the book by called Hare with the Amber Eyes by Edmund de Waal. The
house was taken over by the Nazi administration until 1945.

4. The Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial  is a memorial to the 65,000 Austrian
Jews who were murdered in the Shoah also known as the Nameless Library
and was designed by British artist Rachel Whiteread.
Whiteread&#39;s memorial is a closed, windowless single storey building. It sits on a low
plinth at one end of Judenplatz. The walls are covered from top to bottom in row
upon row of books. But it is as though they have been turned to face the wall. A pair
of doors at one end of the building are sealed shut.
Engraved on the plinth on the two sides and back of the memorial are the names of
those places where Austrian Jews were murdered. Missing are Sajmiste and
Zasavica where Liesl and Emmo were murdered.
Below the Jewish Museum building and square are the remains of a synagogue
destroyed in 1421. There was a thriving Jewish community in this area in medieval
times which came to an end in the violent Vienna Gesera 1420–1421, where the
community was destroyed, and many were burned or expelled.

5. Memorial to War and Fascism by Alfred Hridlicka 1988
The bronze figure of the “Street-Washing Jew” symbolizes the antisemitic violence in
Vienna. In March 1938 Jews were forced by National Socialists to scrub slogans off
the streets with brushes. Alfred Hrdlicka&#39;s memorial faced significant criticism for
failing to adequately address Austrian complicity in the Holocaust, with critics arguing
it perpetuated myths of victimhood. The memorial was seen as reducing Jewish
suffering to a footnote within the broader context of war, rather than acknowledging
the specific role of Austrians in the holocaust.
The humiliated Jew produced a highly uncomfortable image. While the work’s other
elements are seen from below, most put on plinths giving them an aura of respect,
the low bronze of the Jew by contrast is only about 50 cm in height, anchored
directly to the ground.

place.
Light installations were installed at the 25 locations where synagogues and
houses of prayer once stood in Vienna.
The November pogroms of 1938 marked the terrible start of the systematic
persecution and annihilation of the Jewish people. On November 9 and 10, 1938,
businesses in Vienna were plundered and laid to waste, 27 Jews were murdered,
many seriously injured and more than 6,500 Jewish citizens arrested. With only one
exception, all of Vienna’s synagogues and prayer houses were completely
